# TSP-Dynamic-programming
Implementation of the symmetrical Traveling Salesman Problem using dynamic programming technique in C++

This software was developed under Windows with
- Framework Qt 5.1.0
- IDE Qt Creator 2.8.0
- Compiler MinGW 4.8 32bits

Under GNU/Linux with
- Framework Qt 4.8.5
- IDE Qt Creator 2.8.0
- Compiler GCC 4.8.1

The only difference in the Windows version and the Linux version are the "include" code lines and the line to set the icon (file .ico).
This is so for having compiled each version with different framework versions. 
The majority of the code is written in Spanish because this software was used as practical work in an Argentine university.
